# VirtualTourist
iOS NanoDegree Project 4 Virtual Tourist Using Core Data and Flickr Api.

# Project Overview 
The Virtual Tourist app downloads and stores images from Flickr. The app allows users to drop pins on a map, as if they were stops on a tour. Users will then be able to download pictures for the location and persist both the pictures, and the association of the pictures with the pin.

The app will have two view controller scenes.
Travel Locations Map View: Allows the user to drop pins around the world
Photo Album View: Allows the users to download and edit an album for a location
